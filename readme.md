Tennis Report
=============

Activity:

- Install dependencies (pandas and gdown mostly) with `pipenv`. Alternatively, just make sure you have those tools avaialble in your environment.
- Run the python notebook `tennis_data.ipynb`
- Try to understand what is going on: we reverse-engineered the csv report to find how the tables might have been arranged in the original db.
- Do you have differences? do you have suggestions? send a PR.
